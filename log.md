# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: 21 10 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Done freCodeCamp challenge Basic Algorithm Scripting: Falsy Bouncer
2. Done freCodeCamp challenge Basic Algorithm Scripting: Where do I Belong
3. Studied some Regex doing FreeCodeCamp challenges
4. Hello World project from GitHub guide

**Thoughts:** 
This time the Falsy Bouncer challenge went smooth like butter, solved in three minutes, while seemingly beyond reah in all my other tries.

I also solved 'Where do I Belong' in little time, understanding the problem is really a key part of coding I guess.
I have started the following challenge but I felt like I was lacking some knowledge so I did get back to refresh some regular espression.

**Thoughts:** 
FreeCodeCamp is still down, so I've started code wars, my first impression is that it is a nice resource. I am not happy at all with my solution.

I have started designing a personal blog.

### Day 1: 15 10 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Done FreeCodeCamp challenge Basic Algorithm Scripting: Slice and Splice 
2. Worked on FreeCodeCamp challenge Basic Algorithm Scripting: Falsy Bouncer
3. Read some on css and tried challenge Fading World

**Thoughts:** I was stuck for a while in the FreeCodeCamp challenge Slice and Splice , i've finally solved using basic methods slice and concat, I am not happy with the solution but it works so fine for now but I intend to rework it in the future.

Worked a little bit on Falsy Bouncer, I wasn't able to find a solution, I've tried a for loop with a if conditional nested but doing so there are some holes in the returned array, fine for now, back at it tomorrow.

Read something on CSS on the Mozilla Developer Network, good to fill some holes but I'm really not confident in my CSS even after the FreeCodeCamp curriculum on the subject, should I do that again?

Then I've tried the Fading world challenge but to no avail, I plan to get back to it eventually.
