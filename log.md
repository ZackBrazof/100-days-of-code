# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 15 10 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Done FreeCodeCamp challenge Basic Algorithm Scripting: Slice and Splice 
2. Worked on FreeCodeCamp challenge Basic Algorithm Scripting: Falsy Bouncer
3. Read some on css 

**Thoughts:** I was stuck for a while in the FreeCodeCamp challenge Slice and Splice , i've finally solved using basic methods slice and concat, I am not happy with the solution but it works so fine for now but I intend to rework it in the future.

Worked a little bit on Falsy Bouncer, I wasn't able to find a solution, I've tried a for loop with a if conditional nested but doing so there are some holes in the returned array, fine for now, back at it tomorrow.
