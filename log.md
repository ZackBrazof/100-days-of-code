# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 15 10 2019

**Today's Progress**: Done FreeCodeCamp challenge Basic Algorithm Scripting: Slice and Splice 

**Thoughts:** I was stuck for a while in the FreeCodeCamp challenge, i've finally solved using basic methods slice and concat, I am not happy with the solution but it works so fine for now but I intend to rework it in the future.
